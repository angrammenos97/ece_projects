# Operating Systems
This repository contains various programming assignments and examples for the *"Operating Systems"* course. The files in this repository demonstrate concepts such as process management, inter-process communication, memory management, and file operations.

## Description of Files

### sort_pictures.fish
This Fish shell script organizes pictures from a source directory into a target directory, sorting them by year, month, and day based on their creation date.

### pageFaults.m
Implements a page fault handler using the LRU (Least Recently Used) algorithm in MATLAB to understand memory management in operating systems.

### pipe.c
Demonstrates the use of pipes for inter-process communication in C. The program creates a child process and uses a pipe to send data from the child to the parent process.

### realloc.c
This C program illustrates dynamic memory allocation and reallocation. It implements two versions of a stack data structure: one that reallocates memory at each update and another that reallocates at powers of 2 for improved efficiency.

### sjf.m
A MATLAB script implementation of the Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm that demonstrates process scheduling techniques used in operating systems.

### sortlistfork.c
This C program sorts multiple lists in parallel using the fork() system call. It demonstrates the use of process creation and management in operating systems.
