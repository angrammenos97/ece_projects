# Digital Image Processing
This repository contains the source code for three projects completed as part of a *"Digital Image Processing"* course.
## Projects
### 1. Image Manipulation and Feature Detection
This project focuses on fundamental image processing techniques:
- Image rotation
- Local descriptor generation for rotation-invariant feature matching
- Harris corner detection implementation

The goal is to gain practical experience with simple image transformations, feature description, and corner detection algorithms.

        </tr>

### 2. Image Segmentation
This project explores different image segmentation techniques:
- Representing images as graphs
- Non-recursive graph spectral clustering
- Recursive normalized cuts (n-cuts) segmentation
- Superpixel-based segmentation using SLIC

The aim is to understand and implement various approaches to partition images into meaningful segments or regions.![](<Project 2/mario.png>)

### 3. High Dynamic Range (HDR) Imaging
This project deals with creating and processing high dynamic range images:
- Merging multiple low dynamic range (LDR) images into an HDR image
- Tone mapping for HDR image display
- Radiometric calibration using Debevec's method
- Image registration to improve HDR rendering

The objective is to learn techniques for capturing and representing a wider range of luminance in images than standard digital imaging allows.
