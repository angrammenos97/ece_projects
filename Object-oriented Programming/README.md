# Survivor Game Simulator

## Overview
This project was an essay on *"Object-oriented Programming"*, a C++ implementation of a simulator for the "Survivor" TV reality show. It allows users to manage two teams of contestants, add players, view team statistics, and simulate various competition types, including team competitions, quiz competitions, and immunity competitions.

## Project Structure
This project consists of three parts, each building upon the previous one to create a more complex and realistic Survivor game simulation.

### Part 2: Expanded Game Mechanics
- Introduced various competition types (Team, Quiz, Immunity)
- Added different award types (Food, Immunity, Communication)
- Implemented a round-based competition system
- Enhanced player and team attributes

### Part 3: Advanced Voting and Immunity System
- Developed a sophisticated voting system with multiple strategies
- Implemented immunity competitions and awards
- Enhanced player and team management
- Introduced a more complex main game loop focusing on voting days
