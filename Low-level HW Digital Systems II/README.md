# Low-Level HW Digital Systems II
This repository contains the source files for the assignment in the *"Low-Level HW Digital Systems II"* course. It focuses on the design and verification of an Up-Down Counter and a Simple Synchronous FIFO using SystemVerilog.

## Contents

### Up-Down Counter
- counter.sv: SystemVerilog module for the Up-Down Counter
- counter_property.sv: SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) for counter verification
- test_counter.sv: Testbench for the Up-Down Counter

### Simple Synchronous FIFO
- fifo.sv: SystemVerilog module for the FIFO
- fifo_property.sv: SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) for FIFO verification
- test_fifo.sv: Testbench for the FIFO

## Simulation Tool
Questa Intel FPGA Starter Edition

## Assignment Objectives
The main objectives of this assignment were:
- To familiarize students with the design, testing, and verification of logic circuits using a hardware description language.
- To implement an Up-Down Counter and a FIFO memory using SystemVerilog.
- To use SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) for formal verification.
- To create testbenches for functional verification through simulation.
